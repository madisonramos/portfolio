      <p>ArtEmotions aims to predict emotional responses to artworks by analyzing features such as art period, creation year, medium, and subject focus. Building upon the <a href="https://saifmohammad.com/WebPages/wikiartemotions.html">WikiArt Emotions dataset</a>, which comprises 4,105 artworks annotated for emotions evoked in observers, this project refines the data and develops a predictive model to classify viewer reactions as positive, negative, or mixed.
