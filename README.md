      <p>ArtEmotions aims to predict emotional responses to artworks by analyzing features such as art period, creation year, medium, and subject focus. Building upon the <a href="https://saifmohammad.com/WebPages/wikiartemotions.html">WikiArt Emotions dataset</a>, which comprises 4,105 artworks annotated for emotions evoked in observers, this project refines the data and develops a predictive model to classify viewer reactions as positive, negative, or mixed.</p>

      <p>The Student Performance project predicts academic success in writing, reading, and math based on demographic and academic data. Using a dataset from Kaggle, it applies machine learning models to uncover the influence of factors such as gender, parental education, lunch type, and test preparation. The refined subject-specific approach improves accuracy and offers actionable insights for educational improvement.</p>
